# IGW with GYRE
Here I'm looking at IGW in main sequence massive stars. The idea is to look at g-modes with GYRE using MESA background structures.
I'm doing Non-adiabatic since I'm interested in the surface manifestation of the waves and radiative damping is important. The normalization
will come using Daniel Lecoanet theory + numerical simulations
